# Generalizing in Mathematics

Generalization is a very good technique in Mathematical problem solving. Often times, a particular problem looks very difficult in its original form. But when you generalize the problem, often to a higher mathematical structure, then solution becomes quite practical. In this process you learn some deep insight as to why the original problem is true.

Example


In this post, I will briefly describe some techniques used for generalizing a particular problem.

## Some Important Types of Generalizing in Mathematics

### Weakening Hypotheses and Strengthening Conclusions

### Proving a More Abstract Result

### Identifying Characteristic Properties

### Generalization after Reformulation

### Higher Dimensions and Several Variables
